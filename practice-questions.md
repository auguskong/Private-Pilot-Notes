## 4-21 Aircraft Performance 

在哪里看到max weight 是2950?

* Determine the density altitude for these conditions: Altimeter setting - 30.30, Runway temperature - +25°F, Airport elevation - 3,894 it MSL  **On the Altimeter setting chart find 30.3. Its conversion factor is -348. Subtract this from the airport elevation of 3,894. (3,894-348=3546) Enter the Density Altitude chart at +25°F and go up to the 3,546pressure altitude line and read left to find density altitude of approximately 2,200feet.**

### Aerodynamic Forces

* The movement of the air affects the speed at which aircraft move: **Over the Earth's surface**
* The left turning tendency of an airplane caused by P-factor is the result of the **propeller blade descending on the right, producing more thrust than the ascending blade on the left.**
