## Concept

* center of gravity (CG) 
* center of lift (CL)
* Ground Effect
  * A wing operating in ground effect produces less drag and is more efficient. This can allow takeoff at slower than recommended speeds.
* Pressure Altitude
* Density Altitude
* Parasite drag
* Induced drag
* Critical angle of attack: the point at which the 

Add the pressure altitude conversion factor 

29.2 and 29.3 to find a value of 626'. Add this to the 5,250' value for a PA of 5,876'. Move up from 81° F to the PA and read the density altitude at left.



Best Climb speed: depends on attitude and power

Greatest climb speed: depends on angle of attack and amount of power.

Weight & Balance



Empty Weight 

Weight * Arm = Weight 

1 Gallon = 6 pound

High density altitude is equivalent to lower air density = 

high pressure altitude 

 CG is located aft of

Loading an airplane to the most aft CG will cause the airplane to be <u>less stable at all speeds.</u>



Asymmetric Loading (P-Factor)

High Angle of Attack

 descending blade of the propeller having a higher AOA 



Form Drag

Q: Which statement is most correct regarding form drag? 

A: 



What is Stall ? 

Stall airspeed 

Stall angle of attack



high density alt

centrifugal force ? 



airspeed -> angle of attack

Changes in the center of pressure of a wing affect the aircraft's aerodynamic balance and controllability.



Vs0: Lower limit of white arc (VS0)—the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.

Vn0: Incorrect. This is the upper limit of green arc (VN0)—the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.

1 gallon = 6lbs



parasite drag vs. induced drag

* parasite drag: The drag caused by the fuselage and other protrusions disrupting the flow of air 



A standard-rate turn is defined as <u>A turn rate of 3° per second.</u>



As the airplane slows down in flight, the angle of attack must be <u>Increased to maintain altitude.</u>







Airplane System: 

The magnetic compass is self powered

true altitude:  above sea level

Under what condition is pressure altitude and density altitude the same value? At standard temperature

Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperatures are: Below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and the relative humidity is above 80 percent.
