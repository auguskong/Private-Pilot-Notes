**Concept**

* fronts: 
* pre-frontal squall lines
* updrafts & downdrafts
* hail:冰雹 hailstone:  a round ball of [ice](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice) which falls out of a [storm](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm) [cloud](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud)

Three conditions to create a thunderstorm:

* unstable air
* high moisture content
* source of lift



Thunderstorm lifecycle:

* start as cumulus clouds and consist entirely of updrafts
* start of the mature stage begins when the first precipitation falls from the cloud and is characterized by both updrafts and downdrafts. 
* In the mature stage, downdrafts grow in size and occupy the entire cell, the thunderstorm starts to dissipate

### 19. Drag

Induced Drag: By-product of lift

Parasite Drag: 

* Form (profile)
* Skin Friction
* Interference



Drag is produced by moving the airplane through the air, and is considered to act parallel to the relative wind and rearward. 



Form drag increase approximately as the square of the speed increases

Induced drag remains the same regardless of speed changes.



### 20. Closer Look: Reducing Drag

### 21. Thrust, Stability & Center of Gravity 

Effects of the lift and the center of gravity as they relate to stability

properly load an airplane vs. consequences of improper loading 



maneuverable , controllable and stable  相互矛盾

more stability = less maneuverable 

we can affect stability by the way we load the airplane

dihedral:  

what is dihedral ?

lateral / roll stability 

directional stability: 保持直线 

pitch stability: nose up / down

roll stability: 从bank角度 恢复到水平

fuselage: the main body of an aircraft



Positive dihedral: wing tips is higher than the wing root

If an airplane is banked without turning, it tends to side slip toward the lowered wing. because of the dihedral, the lowered wing has a higher angle of attack and produces more lift. This tends to return the airplane to the original wings level position. making it stable. 

**Quiz:**

For 

Q: Lateral or roll stability is normally achieved by

A: The upward pitch of the wings, called dihedral.



Q: Lateral or roll stability is normally achieved by:

A: The upward pitch of the wings, called dihedral.



Q: For directional stability, an airplane tends to weathervane back to a stable position due to: 

A: More fuselage aft of its CG.
