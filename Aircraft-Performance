## Concept

* center of gravity (CG) 
* center of lift (CL)
* Ground Effect
  * A wing operating in ground effect produces less drag and is more efficient. This can allow takeoff at slower than recommended speeds.
* Pressure Altitude
* Density Altitude
* Parasite drag
* Induced drag
* Critical angle of attack: the point at which the 

Add the pressure altitude conversion factor 

29.2 and 29.3 to find a value of 626'. Add this to the 5,250' value for a PA of 5,876'. Move up from 81° F to the PA and read the density altitude at left.



Best Climb speed: depends on attitude and power

Greatest climb speed: depends on angle of attack and amount of power.

Weight & Balance



Empty Weight 

Weight * Arm = Weight 

1 Gallon = 6 pound

High density altitude is equivalent to lower air density



 CG is located aft of

Loading an airplane to the most aft CG will cause the airplane to be <u>less stable at all speeds.</u>
