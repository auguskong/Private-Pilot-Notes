## Chapter 1 Basic Aerodynamics
* Aerodynamic Terms
  * *airfoil*: a structure or body which produces a useful reaction to air movement
  * *chord line*
  * *relative wind*
  * *angle of attack*: the angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the relative wind. By manipulating the aircraft controls, the pilot can vary the angle of attack.
  * *angle of incidence*
  * *drag*: a rearward-acting force which resists the forward movement of an airplane through the air
    * *parasite drag*: resistance of the air produced by any part of an airplane that does not produce lift
    * *induced drag*: a by-product of lift.
* Axes of Rotation and the Four Forces Acting in Flight
* Stability
